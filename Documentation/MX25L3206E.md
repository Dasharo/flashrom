# Flashrom WP test report

## Intro

* Chip name as read from the hardware chip itself: `MX25L3206E`
* Chip name as detected in flashrom: `"MX25L3206E/MX25L3208E"`
* [RTE](https://docs.dasharo.com/transparent-validation/rte/introduction/) was
  used as an external programmer and to control the WP pin state via software
  - any other programmer could be used there instead
* [flash.sh](flash.sh) script was used as a wrapper for flashrom commands -
  please refer there if you need to take a look at the full flashrom commands

* We can see that the `protection range` was set as desired

* We can see that the `protection mode` was changed to `hardware`

## Test WP protection

* Drive the WP pin LOW:

```shell
root@rte:~# ./flash.sh wp-low
Setting WP pin LOW ...
```

* Try erasing:

```shell

WARNING!: Updating only part of the image might render your device unusable if old and
          new parts are not compatible!

          If you think you know what you're doing, pass --skip-wp-area to exclude
          protected part of the flash from the operation.
Your flash chip is in an unknown state.

## Disable WP protection

* Set region `0,0` and disable protection (with WP pin still being LOW):

```shell
root@rte:~# ./flash.sh wp-disable
set SPI Vcc to 3.3V
SPI lines ON
SPI Vcc ON
